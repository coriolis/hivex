This directory contains test images for the hivex library.

'minimal' is a valid registry containing a single root nk (with
associated sk) which was created by chopping out everything possible
from a Windows 2003 software hive and then doing lots of hand edits on
the result.  There is no "source" for it as such, it is just a
hand-crafted binary blob.

'large' is a procedurally generated, large hive.  The program
'mklarge.c' is used to make this during the build.  It is used during
tests.
