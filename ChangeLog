	Update to latest gnulib (RHBZ#756981).

	Revert "out of tree build: ruby"
	This reverts commit 48d2e0d9ea5c12ae81f31706fa463f8e1ebd09af.

	This commit breaks the ordinary build:

	make[2]: Entering directory `/home/rjones/d/hivex/ruby'
	rake build
	rake/rdoctask is deprecated.  Use rdoc/task instead (in RDoc 2.4.2+)
	rake/gempackagetask is deprecated.  Use rubygems/package_task instead

	hivexml: Do not print null input times
	Dealing with "1601-01-01T00:00:00Z" is unnecessarily awkward, especially

	hivexml: Report attributes in values instead of text.
	Reporting value data in attributes has two advantages:
	* The output of hivexml breaks Python expat processing if binary data
	makes it out.  This was observed in Software hives.
	* Not having child text makes room for child elements.

	hivex: Add metadata length functions for nodes and values
	This patch adds hivex_node_struct_length and hivex_value_struct_length
	to the hivex ABI, to report the amount of hive space used for each
	stored structure.


	A fix added by RWMJ.

	hivex: Split value_key function into value_key and value_key_len
	This function breaks the value name calculation out so the name does
	not need to be fetched and immediately thrown away when one only needs
	the name.


	RWMJ fixed hivex_value_key handling of errno.

	generator: Add new return type to ABI: RSize
	This patch adds RSize, similar to RNode and RValue.


	OCaml bindings fixed by RWMJ.

2011-08-13  Alex Nelson  <ajnelson@cs.ucsc.edu>

	Report last-modified time of hive root and nodes
	The infrastructure for modified-time reporting has been essentially
	unused.  These changes report the registry time by treating the
	time fields as Windows filetime fields stored in little-Endian
	(which means they can be treated as a single 64-bit little-Endian
	integer).

	This patch adds to the hivex ABI:

	 * int64_t hivex_last_modified (hive_h *)
	 * int64_t hivex_node_timestamp (hive_h *, hive_node_h)

	These two functions return the hive's last-modified time and
	a particular node's last-modified time, respectively.  Credit
	to Richard Jones for the ABI suggestion, and for the tip on
	Microsoft's filetime time span.

	hivexml employs these two functions to produce mtime elements
	for a hive and all of its nodes, producing ISO-8601 formatted
	time.


	A lot of code cleanup by RWMJ.

2011-07-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	perl: Fix CCFLAGS on Perl 5.14.
	A change to ExtUtils::CBuilder in Perl 5.14 causes CCFLAGS to
	completely replace, rather than appending, the C flags.

	The unfortunate consequence of this is that vital flags such as
	-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 are missing.  For 32 bit code, this means you
	get binary-incompatible code that completely fails to load.

	For further analysis see:

	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2011/04/msg171535.html

	This commit changes CCFLAGS so that it appends to the existing
	$Config{ccflags} instead of replacing it.  On earlier versions of Perl
	this means we get two copies of the flags, which is unfortunate but
	should be safe.

	Also, ignore MYMETA.yml file produced by Perl 5.14.

	hivex/python fix for i386 integer size issue
	Hi,

	While working on Debian packages of hivex 1.2.5, I came across a test
	failure for the Python bindings with Python 2.7 on the i386
	architecture. (The tests ran fine on amd64.)

	,----
	| $ make -C python check
	| make[1]: Entering directory `/home/bengen/src/deb/hivex/hivex.git/python'
	| 010-import.py
	| 020-open.py
	| 021-close.py
	| 200-write.py
	| python: hivex-py.c:52: get_handle: Assertion `obj' failed.
	`----

	I narrowed this down to hivex-py.c:py_hivex_node_add_child():

	The call

	,----
	| PyArg_ParseTuple (args, (char *) "OLs:hivex_node_add_child",
	|                         &py_h, &parent, &name)
	`----

	results in `py_h' set to NULL, though Python's documentation claims that
	this cannot happen. I think this happens because `parent' is declared a
	`long int', but "L" in the format string corresponds to a `long long'.
	On amd64, they have the same size, but on i386 they don't, so the
	PyObject pointer is written to the wrong address.

	Please consider applying the patch below which just changes the format
	string. After regenerating hivex-py.c, I have successfully tested the
	1.2.5 code base on both architectures.

	Cheers,
	-Hilko

	maint: Split long lines.

2011-04-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.2.5.
	Updated PO files.

	Remove no longer used internal function utf16_string_len_in_bytes.

	hivex_value_multiple_strings: Don't read uninitialized data.
	If hivex_value_multiple_strings was given a value which had an odd
	length or if the data in the value was unterminated,
	hivex_value_multiple_strings could read uninitialized data.

	Potentially (although very unlikely) this could cause a
	non-exploitable segfault in the calling program.

	Handle odd-length "UTF16" strings.
	If the length of the buffer is not even, then this would read a byte
	of uninitialized data.  Fix the length check to avoid this.

	Return real length of buffer from hivex_value_value.
	In real registries, often the length declared in the header does not
	match the length of the block.  In this case hivex_value_value would
	only allocate a value with a size which is the shorter of the two
	length values, which is correct and safe.

	However user code could do:

	  buf = hivex_value_value (h, v, &t, &len);
	  memcpy (somewhere, buf, len);

	which would copy uninitialized data.

	If hivex_value_value truncates a value like this, we also need to
	return the shorter length to the user as well.

	Really fix the case where a UTF-16 string contains junk after the string.
	The previous commit b71b88f588f8660935a7d462e97b84aa2d669249 attempted
	to fix this, but got the test the wrong way round so the length would
	never be shorter.

	When you import a string value like:

	be something like:

	Add maintainer rule for updating the website.

	hivexml: Fix path so HTML documentation is generated correctly.

	Prepare for version 1.2.1.

	hivexregedit: Low-level tool for merging and export in regedit format.

	Win::Hivex::Regedit module for importing and exporting regedit format files.

	hivexsh: '-f' option takes an argument (found by Marko Myllynen).

2010-03-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Zero all new block allocations.
	Make sure all new block allocations (from allocate_block)
	are zeroed.  It can happen that junk from previous hive pages
	can end up in new block allocations, if the hive previously
	shrank.

	(Thanks to Marko Myllynen for finding an example where this
	happened).

	Increase HIVEX_MAX_VALUES from 1000 to 10000.
	I was sent a genuine Windows XP hive by Marko Myllynen which
	had a key with > 1000 values attached.

2010-03-26  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Increase HIVEX_MAX_SUBKEYS to 15000.
	Windows 7 registry has a hive key which contains 11908 subkeys,
	larger than the existing limit (10000).  The key is:
	  HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SideBySide\Winners

	hivex: Add debugging message when returning ERANGE error.

	hivexsh: Fix building of HTML-format manpages.

2010-03-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	perl: Fix $h->value_value method when returning an empty value.
	Previously this didn't correctly return an empty registry
	value.  In this case the length argument to newSVpv would
	be 0 which tells Perl to try to calculate the length (we
	want newSVpvn instead).

	Fix generation of po/POTFILES.in.
	Contains some obsolete code copied in from libguestfs, and we
	need to exclude Perl 'blib' files.

	perl: Small fix to 006-pod-coverage test.
	Some code copied over from libguestfs, fixed.

	perl: Fix $h->value_type and $h->value_value methods.
	These were passing the type & len arguments the wrong way round
	to the C function, resulting in data corruption in the returned
	values.

2010-02-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	NO Python bindings - ran out of time.
	This commit disables parts of the build related to Python
	and notes in the README that we didn't have time to finish
	Python bindings.

	generator: Perl bindings.
	This also adds a small test suite for the Perl bindings.

	generator: Clarify LGPLv2 boilerplate.

	More documentation in README file.

	hivexsh: Fix compilation on 32 bit machines.

2010-02-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Remove bogus msgstr from kn.po.

2010-02-24  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Add OCaml bindings.
	Also we tighten up the definition of hivex_close (it disposes of handles)
	and hivex_node_get_child (unusual "not found" non-error condition).

	This also adds tests of the OCaml bindings.

	Add build framework for OCaml, Perl, Python bindings.
	(No bindings are actually built, this just adds the build, test
	and generator framework for them).

	configure: Comment out Ruby, Java, Haskell detection.
	We will not be implementing bindings for Ruby, Java or Haskell
	unless someone pitches in to do the work.  Therefore comment out
	the code which detects these languages in the configure script.

	(This leaves OCaml, Perl, Python, which we will be writing
	bindings for).

	Create separate toplevel directories for hivexsh and hivexml.

	Rename hivex/ -> lib/

	Move test images to images/ and add a large, generated test image.
	Previously we had one minimal test image.  This was located in
	hivex/t (a subdirectory of the main library).

	This adds a large, procedurally generated test image.  Because
	this needs to be built using hivex code, and because subdirectories
	are built before the parent directory by automake, we have to
	also move the directory location to a top-level directory called
	images/.

2010-02-24  Shankar Prasad  <svenkate@redhat.com>

	Added Kannada translation (RHBZ#567860).

2010-02-23  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Fix allocations that may move C heap buffer.
	When heavily extending existing hive files, the malloc-allocated
	in-memory copy of the hive may be moved when we reallocate it
	(to increase its size).  However we didn't adjust existing
	pointers to cope with this, so sometimes you could get a segfault.

	This patch fixes the issue by adjusting pointers as necessary
	after calling (directly or indirectly) to the allocate_block
	function.

	With this patch I was able to allocate 10,000's of blocks in
	a deeply nested hive structure without any problems being reported
	by valgrind.

	Link gnulib in to the hivex library, not end-user programs.
	Gnulib should be statically linked into the hivex library, so
	it gets included into end-user programs automatically.  Otherwise
	end-user programs would have to link explicitly with gnulib.

2010-02-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: More minor formatting adjustments to POD documentation.

	generator: Minor adjustments to the C POD documentation.

	Add a generator for generating bindings to other languages.
	At the moment the generator just generates the C header file
	and C POD documentation.  This just so we can compare the existing
	hand-written code with the generated code to make sure that our
	description of the API within the generator is correct.

	Remove bogus reference to src/ directory which no longer exists.

	Update copyright notice and change libguestfs to hivex.

	Version 1.1.2

	Install hivex.h in $includedir.

	Version 1.1.1.
	Also some minor fixes to the build system.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Move README, LICENSE files to the toplevel directory.

	gnulib: Remove some unused modules.

	Version 1.1.0

	po: Import pofiles and various build fixes.

	Sort and complete m4/.gitignore file.

	Add gettext.h, omitted from earlier import.

	gnulib: Include xstrtol, xstrtoll modules.
	These were omitted from the earlier code import from libguestfs.

	Add html/ directory, include POD CSS.

	hivexsh: Print hex bytes >= 0x80 correctly.
	These were being interpreted as signed chars, and thus printed
	as "ffffff80" etc.

	Remove some unused variables.
	Since we have to compile with -Wno-unused-variables, we don't
	spot unused variables in code.  I found these by compiling the
	code in Ubuntu.

	Add scripts to EXTRA_DIST.

	hivex: example6: Don't double backslashes.

	hivex: example6: Hypothetical addition of keys for viostor.

	hivex: Fix handling of inline VKs.

	hivexsh: Set correct type for 'expandstring' values.

	hivex: Documentation and cleanups.

	hivex: Make limits into macros.

	hivexsh: Remove unused variable.
	This removes an unused variable left over by
	commit ab608f3948d903af64e814b2e67949a1a71d93a4.

	hivex: Complete the implementation of adding child nodes.

	hivex: More debugging around nk 'unknown2' field.

	hivex: Check hash fields in lf/lh records.

	hivexsh: del command: Fix error message.

	hivexsh: lsval: Remove stray quotation mark.

	hivexsh: cd command: fix error handling
	The error behaviour of hivex_node_get_child is subtle, so the 'cd'
	command wouldn't always report errors correctly.  This fixes it.

	hivex: allocate_block should update valid block bitmap.
	The internal allocate_block() function wasn't updating the bitmap,
	so if you revisited a block which you had allocated in the same
	session, you could get an EFAULT error.

	hivex: More debug messages.

	hivex: Documentation update.
	ntreg_lf_record can have id "lf" (old-style hashes) or "lh" (new-
	style hashes).

	hivex: Some missing le32toh endianness conversions.

	hivexsh: Document some peculiarities of the "cd" command.

	hivex: Implement deleting child nodes.

	hivex: Add flags argument to internal get_children() function.
	When we later call get_children to visit the intermediate
	ri/lf/lh records, we have already deleted the subkey nk-records,
	so checking that those nk-records are still valid is not very
	helpful.

	This commit adds a flag to turn these checks off.

	hivex: Don't die on valid registries which have bad declared data lengths.
	Some apparently valid registries contain value data length
	declarations which exceed the allocated block size for the
	value.

	Previously the code would return EFAULT for such registries.
	However since these appear to be otherwise valid registries,
	turn this into a warning and just use the allocated block size
	as the data length (in other words, truncate the value).

	hivex: Minimal registry example.
	This is the smallest registry you can make and still have it
	load correctly in Windows regedit.

	hivexsh: Add 'setval' and 'commit' commands.
	This adds the 'setval' and 'commit' commands to the hivex shell.

	Also adds some example scripts showing use of these.

	hivex: Begin implementation of writing to hives.
	This implements hivex_node_set_values which is used to
	delete the (key, value) pairs at a node and optionally
	replace them with a new set.

	This also implements hivex_commit which is used to commit
	changes to hives back to disk.

	hivex: Add HIVEX_OPEN_WRITE flag to allow hive to be opened for writing.
	If this flag is omitted (as in the case for all existing callers)
	then the hive is still opened read-only.

	We add a 'writable' flag to the hive handle, and we change the way
	that the hive file (data) is stored.  The data is still mmapped if
	the file is opened read-only, since that is more efficient and allows
	us to handle larger hives.  However if we need to write to the file
	then we have to read it all into memory, since if we had to extend the
	file we need to realloc that data.

	Note the manpage section L</WRITING TO HIVE FILES> comes in a later
	commit.

	Tools for analyzing and reverse engineering hive files.
	This commit is not of general interest.  It contains the tools which
	I used to reverse engineer the hive format and to test changes.
	Keeping these with the rest of the code is useful in case in future
	we encounter a hive file that we fail to modify.

	Note that the tools are not compiled by default.  You have to compile
	each explicitly with:

	  make -C hivex/tools <toolname>.opt

	You will also need ocaml-extlib-devel and ocaml-bitstring-devel.

	hivexsh: Change some exit(1) -> exit(EXIT_FAILURE)

	hivexsh: Only print final \n when interactive.
	When hivexsh was called non-interactively, it would print an
	annoying extra line.  Only print this line if we are being
	used interactively.

	hivexsh: Change handling of prompt argument to rl_gets()
	Make the result of isatty into a global variable (is_tty).

	Change the rl_gets() function so it takes the prompt string
	instead of a "display prompt?" flag.  rl_gets() then consults
	the global to find out if it should display the prompt at all.

	Document that this flag is clear for default keys.

	Misc documentation and gitignore update.

	Move htole*/le*toh macros into a separate header file.
	This allows us to reuse these macros in hivexsh later.

	hivex: Reimplement hivexget as a simple shell script.
	hivexget is currently a large C program.  Now that we have hivexsh
	(the shell) we can reimplement hivexget as a simple bash script that
	calls out to hivexsh.

	hivex: Add 'hivexsh' program (shell for navigating registry hives).

	Set locale in C programs so l10n works (RHBZ#559962).
	This commit adds the calls to setlocale &c to all of the current
	C programs.

	It also adds l10n support to hivexget and hivexml which lacked them
	previously.

	To test this, try:

	LANG=pa_IN.UTF-8 guestfish --cmd-help

	(You can only do this test after installing the package, or at
	least the 'pa.mo' mo-file in the correct place).

	hivex: Const-correctness fix on header_checksum (thanks Jim Meyering).

	hivex: Update some previously unknown nk-record fields.
	Update these fields with what we found out from reverse engineering
	the file.  Also bring the unknownX field names into line with
	visualizer.ml.

	hivex: Fix calculation of block size for vk data blocks.

	hivex: Display incorrect block size as unsigned in an error message.

	hivex: display bad block offset in hex

	hivex: hive type in vk-record is an unsigned 32 bit int

	hivex: Add missing le32toh conversion around field access.
	This was missing.  It only worked because we test on a little
	endian platform.

	hivex: Clarify some more fields.
	Taken from sentinelchicken.com documentation.

	hivex: Modify children/values functions to return intermediate blocks.
	Modify the functions that return child subnodes and values so they
	can also be used to return a list of the intermediate blocks.  This
	is so we can delete those intermediate blocks (in a later commit).

	We also introduce an offset_list structure which is used for collecting
	lists of offsets, ie. lists of nodes, values or blocks.

	Note that this commit should not change the semantics of the code.

	hivex: Add value_any callback to the visitor.
	The visitor currently contains lots of value_* callbacks, such as
	value_string which is called back when the value has type string.

	This is fine but it makes it complicated to deal with the case where
	you just want to see 'a value', and don't care about its type.

	The value_any callback allows visitors to see values generically.

	hivex: Move header checksum code into a function.
	This function can be reused later.

	hivex: page 'offset_next' field is really 'page_size'.
	The documentation, as usual, is contradictory.  However this
	field is definitely the page size in all observed registries.
	Furthermore the following field marked 'unknown' is always
	zero, although this contradicts what the sentinelchicken.com
	paper says.

	hivex: Collect more statistics about registries.

	hivex: Store filename in hive handle.

	hivex: Various improvements in header parsing, thanks to better documentation.

	hivex: Print header fields.  Print all offsets in hex (in debug output).

	hivex: Reenable checksum calculations, but don't check result.

	hivex: Update documentation.

	hivex: Send all debug messages to stderr.

	hivex: Remove stray debugging message.

	hivex: Documentation: Add environment variables section.

	hivex: Whitespace change.

	hivex: Move STR* macros into C file.
	Don't pollute the public header file with these macros.

	hivex: Small updates to the documentation.
