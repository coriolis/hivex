=head1 NAME

hivexget - Get subkey from a Windows Registry binary "hive" file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 hivexget hivefile '\Path\To\SubKey'

 hivexget hivefile '\Path\To\SubKey' name

=head1 NOTE

This is a low-level tool.  For a more convenient way to navigate the
Windows Registry in Windows virtual machines, see L<virt-win-reg(1)>.
For proper regedit formatting, use L<hivexregedit(1)>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program navigates through a Windows Registry binary "hive"
file and extracts I<either> all the (key, value) data pairs
stored in that subkey I<or> just the single named data item.

In the first form:

 hivexget hivefile '\Path\To\SubKey'

C<hivefile> is some Windows Registry binary hive, and C<\Path\To\Subkey>
is a path within that hive.  I<NB> the path is relative to the top
of this hive, and is I<not> the full path as you would use in Windows
(eg. C<HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM> is not a valid path).

If the subkey exists, then the output lists all data pairs under this
subkey, in a format similar to C<regedit> in Windows.

In the second form:

 hivexget hivefile '\Path\To\SubKey' name

C<hivefile> and path are as above.  C<name> is the name of the value
of interest (use C<@> for the default value).

The corresponding data item is printed "raw" (ie. no processing or
escaping) except:

=over 4

=item 1

If it's a string we will convert it from Windows UTF-16 to UTF-8, if
this conversion is possible.  The string is printed with a single
trailing newline.

=item 2

If it's a multiple-string value, each string is printed on a separate
line.

=item 3

If it's a numeric value, it is printed as a decimal number.
