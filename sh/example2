# Example program which modifies a hive.
#
# This program removes any existing (key, value) pairs at the root
# node and replaces them with some example values.
#
# You can load the modified hive using another tool to see the
# changes.  eg. Using Windows regedit, select HKLM and then in the
# File menu choose "Load Hive ...".  Point to the update hive, and
# then give a key (eg. "test1").  The modified hive will be loaded
# under HKLM\test1 and the values can be inspected there.  After
# inspecting the changes, unload the hive using File -> Unload Hive.
#
# Don't replace the original Windows hive, else you'll break things :-)
