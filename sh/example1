# The intention of this example is just to check that we can do this
# without corrupting the hive (header etc).
#
# NB: The copy of the hive will not be absolutely identical.  The
# sequence numbers in the header will change.  If we implement the
# last modified field in the header, then that and the checksum will
# also change.
